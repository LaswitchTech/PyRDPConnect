## Description
PyRDPConnect is a cross-platform Python application designed to provide a sleek, modern, and efficient front-end interface for connecting to Remote Desktop (RDP) sessions. Built with PyQt5, the application supports both macOS and Linux, offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience for users who need to manage RDP connections across multiple environments.

## Features
  - **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: PyRDPConnect is compatible with both macOS and Linux, with specific adjustments made to ensure seamless operation on both operating systems.
  - **Customizable Interface**: The application uses a customizable UI that allows users to define their preferred settings, such as server address, resolution, multi-monitor support, sound redirection, and more.
  - **Auto-Detection of FreeRDP Version**: The application automatically detects the version of FreeRDP installed on the system and adjusts the command syntax accordingly, ensuring compatibility with both older and newer versions of FreeRDP.
  - **Bundled FreeRDP**: PyRDPConnect includes the ability to package the correct version of FreeRDP within the application, simplifying deployment and reducing dependency issues.
  - **Certificate Handling**: The application handles SSL certificates during connection attempts, providing users with the option to accept or reject untrusted certificates through a dialog box.
  - **Resource Management**: The application efficiently manages resources, including styles, icons, and other assets, ensuring they are bundled correctly in the final application package.
  - **Connection Management**: The interface includes a progress dialog to indicate the status of connection attempts, with options to cancel the attempt if necessary.
  - **Logging and Debugging**: The application includes logging features for easier debugging and tracking of issues during the connection process.
